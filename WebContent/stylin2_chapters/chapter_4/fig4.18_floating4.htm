On a sunny summer's day, it is a wonderful place to hike and enjoy  the incredible views. When the mist and rain roll in, Dartmoor can be a lonely  and scary place where it's easy to lose your way&mdash;it's where Sherlock Holmes met the Hound of the Baskervilles.  Because this text is longer than the picture of the moorlands, the next image of the Devon cottage  is over to the left side as part of a new paragraph, which is exactly what  we want to have happen.</p><p><img src="images/english-cottage.jpg" alt="Devon Cottage" /></p><p> My sister lived in this delightful cottage by a stream in Devon until very  recently&mdash;my daughter said she saw fairies in the garden one summer night.  Because this text is short, the next image and text also move up next to the  floated image of the cottage.</p><div class="clearthefloats"></div><img src="images/windsor-castle_walls.jpg" alt="Windsor Castle, England" /><p>The Queen of England prefers somewhere a little more spacious and secure.  Windsor Castle is her favorite place to hang out with the family and her Corgi  dogs. With the clearing element added, this text now clears (moves below)  the previous floated elements and sits correctly alongside this image. </p></body></html>
